#Business Understanding
Objective: The goal of this project is to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on various features, such as the client's personal information, contact details, and campaign characteristics. The data is related to phone calls made during a direct marketing campaign by a Portuguese banking institution.

###Business Problem:

The bank wants to increase the efficiency of its marketing campaigns. By predicting whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on past interactions and client information, the bank can focus resources on high-potential leads, improving conversion rates and minimizing marketing costs.
Goal: Build a predictive model that can classify whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit (the target variable y). The model should aim to accurately predict this binary outcome.
